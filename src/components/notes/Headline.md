# Headline

Displays a large piece of text with a cool line underneath.

Accepts a `value` prop which is a string of text to be show, and a `fontSize` prop which allows you to override the default size of the headline text, with units in `rem`.

### Example

A very important piece headline with a overriden font size of `1.8rem`.

```javascript
<Headline value="Big Important Text" fontSize={1.8} />
```
